# v4.9.0

* Added support for Bot API 6.1.
* Added support for Bot API 6.2.
* Updated typegram. Uses a [fork](https://github.com/MKRhere/typegram) until upstream is updated.
* Added method `Telegraf::createWebhook` which calls `setWebhook` first, and returns Promise of Express-style middleware. [[Example]](https://github.com/feathers-studio/telegraf-docs/blob/master/examples/webhook/express.ts)
* Updated Telegraf binary; it is now written in TS, and supports ESM modules and new command-line options `--method` and `--data` to call API methods from the command-line.
* Added experimental export of Telegraf's convenience types, such as the `Extra*` parameter types, now found as: `import type { Convenience } from "telegraf/types"`
* Added `Context::sendMessage` and `Context:sendWith*` methods mirroring `Context::reply` and `Context::replyWith*` methods respectively.
* Added new middleware: `import { useNewReplies } from telegraf/future` that changes the behaviour of `Context::reply*` methods to actually reply to the context message.
* (docs) New documentation effort started at [feathers-studio/telegraf-docs](https://github.com/feathers-studio/telegraf-docs).
* (docs) All doc examples were moved to new repo and updated to full TS and ESM.
* (internal) Removed `Telegraf::handleUpdates`.
* (internal) Accept `req.body` as Buffer or string instead of parsed object for compatibility with [serverless-http](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http).

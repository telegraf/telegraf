# 4.10.1

- Fixed: `fmt` now allows any type instead of only `string | FmtString`.
  In the [last release](./4.10.0.md), we added `telegraf/fmt` - but it didn't work if you used numbers or other objects in your template literal. Since you'd usually expect this to "just work", we've made that possible.

  This now works as expected when `total` and `codesCount` are numbers (or other objects).

  ```TS
  fmt`${bold`Analytics`}
  Current pro users: ${total}
  Available redeem codes: ${codesCount}`
  ```
